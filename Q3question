3     Create a class called "Book" with the following data members:
title (string)
author (string)
ISBN (string)
price (double)
stock (int)
In the main function, create an instance of the Book class and initialize its data members. Then, use the fstream
library to open a file for writing and write the contents of the Book object to the file in binary format.

ans=

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
// Class to define the properties
class book {
public:
   string title,author,ISBN;
   int stock;
   double price;
};
int main(){
   book ob;
   ob.title="The story";
   ob.author="Helen";
   ob.ISBN="lki";
   ob.price=50.6;
   ob.stock=52;

   ofstream file1;
   file1.open("book.txt", ios::binary);
   file1.write((char*)&ob,sizeof(ob));
   file1.close();
   
   cout<<"book info is saved"<<endl;
   return 0;
}
