1.	Write a program that creates a class called "Student" with the following data members:
name (string)
age (int)
grade (double)
In the main function, create an instance of the Student class and initialize its data members. Then, open a file for writing and write the contents of the Student object to the file.

ANS=
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;
class student
{
	public:
		string name;
		int age;
		double grade;
		
		student(string a,int b, double c)
		{
			name=a;
			age=b;
			grade=c;
		}
};
int main()
{
	student s("info",12,97.04);
	fstream file;
	file.open("info",ios::out);
	file<<s.name<<" "<<s.age<<" "<<s.grade;
}
